// This file is a placeholder for future push notification logic.
// The actual logic is very complex and would involve service workers and
// a push notification service. Here's a brief example of what that would look like.

// Check for service worker support
if ("serviceWorker" in navigator && "PushManager" in window) {
  // When the page loads, register the service worker
  window.addEventListener("load", () => {
    navigator.serviceWorker
      .register("/sw.js")
      .then((registration) => {
        console.log("Service Worker registered!");
        // After registration, get push notification permission
        // This is where the push logic would be.
        // You would need to set up a push service and pass keys.
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error("Service Worker registration failed:", error);
      });
  });
}
